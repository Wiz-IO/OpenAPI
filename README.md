OpenAPI is the sharing of Kernel ( Firmware ) functions to Userware applications

or dynamically linking statically compiled applications

Traditionally called: Position Independent Code ( PIC )<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code
In order for applications to work regardless of their absolute address relative to the kernel, they use:<br>
PLT (Procedure Linkage Table), GOT (Global Offset Table) and Dynamic Linker (Kernel Procedure)
