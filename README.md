# OpenAPI

OpenAPI is the sharing of Kernel ( Firmware ) functions to Userware applications<br>
or dynamically linking statically compiled applications<br>

Traditionally called: Position Independent Code ( PIC )<br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code <br>
In order for applications to work regardless of their absolute address relative to the kernel, they use:<br>
* **PLT** (Procedure Linkage Table), 
* **GOT** (Global Offset Table) and 
* **Dynamic Linker** ( Kernel Procedure )
